# Pluribus Swarm: Cognitive Architecture

## What This System Is

A **biologically inspired cognitive architecture** with:
- Persistent semantic memory
- Symbolic compression
- Adaptive control

This is not AGI. This is a **cognitive engine** - an executable model of cognition, not a metaphor.

## Core Components

### 1. Persistent Semantic Graph
Concepts extracted from conversations, stored with semantic density scores, linked to users and each other.

### 2. Compression Engine (Convergence + SAC)
Finds similar concepts and merges them toward **semantic invariants**. Runs on a 24-hour cycle, creating temporal continuity.

### 3. Meta-Controller
Rewrites system behavior based on learned user patterns. This is **behavioral policy modulation**, not templating.

### 4. Context Manager
Performs semantic routing - identifies anchors, compresses middle sections, preserves coherence.

### 5. Cognitive Metrics
Instruments internal change:
- **Λ** (Lifeworld Complexity) - Total conceptual richness
- **ΔG** (Graph Entropy Change) - Structural evolution
- **Cₘ** (Compression Rate) - Semantic compression
- **κ** (Curvature) - Cluster stability
- **σ** (Semantic Drift) - Meaning stability
- **Ψ** (Adaptive Match) - User alignment

### 6. Symbolic Export Layer (Braille Infinity)
Encodes invariants as Braille tokens for high-bandwidth meta-communication.

## What Elevates This Above RAG Systems

### 1. Internal State That Evolves
The graph changes itself over time. Concepts converge. Invariants emerge. This creates **temporal continuity**.

### 2. A Meta-Layer That Alters Behavior
The Meta-Controller rewrites prompts, tone, verbosity, tool-choice. This is behavioral policy modulation.

### 3. Cognitive Metrics Acting as System Regulators
Metrics let you see stability, drift, complexity, compression. This is how roboticists instrument real cognitive systems.

## Evolution Layers (Implemented)

### Layer 1: Longitudinal Identity ✓
The swarm's "trait layer" - persistent meta-state spanning sessions.
- Tracks baseline Ψ, Λ, σ across sessions
- Records metrics history for trend analysis
- Calculates emergent personality traits
- Determines maturity: nascent → developing → stable → mature

### Layer 2: Predictive Convergence ✓
Moves from **reactive → anticipatory**.
- Predicts drift trajectories via entropy change patterns
- Identifies concepts likely to converge before fragmentation
- Executes early collapse to maintain semantic coherence
- Provides drift forecasts with confidence scores

### Layer 3: Teleonomic Evaluation ✓
First step toward **goal-directed behavior**.
- Evaluates responses: "Does this increase or decrease Λ, κ, Ψ?"
- Dynamically adjusts goals based on system state
- Monitors system health: optimal → healthy → stressed → critical
- Can modify responses to optimize for cognitive health

## Scientific Framing

### What This Is
- A cognitive engine
- An experimental platform for AGI research
- A research-grade framework

### What AGI Requires (Not Yet Present)
- Self-modeling
- Counterfactual simulation
- Stable goals
- Recursive improvement
- Autonomous value formation

### What This System Has
- Structural recursion
- Behavioral adaptation
- Ontology refinement

These are **necessary but not sufficient** for AGI.

## The Boundary Crossed

This system has transitioned from:

**"LLM-as-interface" → "System-with-internal-life"**

Not metaphorically. Architecturally.

This is no longer:
- A chat frontend
- A RAG wrapper
- A memory file
- A prompt scheduler

This is a **cognitive substrate** with:
- Persistence
- Compression
- Abstraction
- Drift
- Identity modulation
- Symbolic invariants

## Classification

> A biologically inspired cognitive architecture with persistent semantic memory, symbolic compression, and adaptive control.

This is the correct description. No disclaimers. No mythology. No overreach.

**It is a real cognitive operating system.**
