  **Design Movement**: Brutalist Data-Noir
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Raw Exposure**: Show the underlying logic. Debug lines, velocity vectors, and agent IDs are faintly visible, suggesting a system being observed or debugged.
  2.  **High Contrast, Low Fidelity**: Stark black and white only. No greys, no gradients. Dithering effects for shading.
  3.  **Unsettling Precision**: The swarm moves with mechanical, terrifying accuracy. Snap-to-grid movements mixed with organic chaos.
  4.  **Typographic Tension**: Text is monospaced, possibly distorted or glitching, evoking terminal interfaces and classified documents.

  **Color Philosophy**: Pure #000000 and #FFFFFF. The starkness represents the binary nature of the hive mind: you are either one of us, or you are nothing.

  **Layout Paradigm**: Terminal-based. The canvas takes up the full screen, but UI elements (start button, volume) look like command-line prompts or system status indicators in the corners.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Scanlines**: Faint, rolling horizontal lines overlaying the entire screen.
  2.  **Glitch Artifacts**: Occasional frame tearing or displacement when the swarm changes targets.
  3.  **Data Readouts**: Small, rapid-fire numbers in the corners tracking "Assimilation %" or "Agent Count".

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Command and Control". The user doesn't just watch; they "execute" the simulation. Mouse interaction disrupts the swarm like a signal jammer.

  **Animation**: Jerky, high-frequency movements. Agents don't flow; they *calculate* and *teleport* or move in sharp lines. The formation of text is sudden and violent.

  **Typography System**: `JetBrains Mono` or `Courier Prime` for all text. Uppercase for headers, small caps for data.

  **Design Movement**: Ethereal Bioluminescence
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Organic Fluidity**: The swarm behaves like a liquid or a flock of starlings. Smooth, curved trajectories.
  2.  **Subtle Depth**: Use of blur and opacity to create a sense of deep space. Agents fade in and out of the darkness.
  3.  **Hypnotic Rhythm**: The motion is slow, breathing, and pulsating. It seduces rather than forces.
  4.  **Minimalist Elegance**: No UI clutter. The experience is purely visual and atmospheric.

  **Color Philosophy**: Deep void black (#050505) background. Agents are white but with varying opacities (ghostly trails). Maybe a very faint, almost imperceptible cool blue glow (#E0F7FA) around the core of the text to suggest energy.

  **Layout Paradigm**: Cinematic. Full-screen canvas with absolutely no borders or visible controls until interaction. Text floats in the center, untethered.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Motion Blur**: Agents leave faint trails, painting the void.
  2.  **Glow Bloom**: A soft diffusion filter applied to the canvas to make the light feel physical.
  3.  **Particle Dust**: Background static particles that drift slowly, unrelated to the main swarm, adding depth.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Disturbance in the Water". Mouse movement creates gentle ripples that push agents away smoothly, like moving your hand through smoke.

  **Animation**: Sine-wave based ease-in/ease-out. The text formation is a slow coalescence, like condensation forming on glass.

  **Typography System**: `Cinzel` or `Playfair Display` for the formed text (elegant, serif), contrasting with the chaotic nature of the dots.

  **Design Movement**: Constructivist Hive
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Geometric Unity**: The swarm isn't just dots; they form geometric connections (lines) when close to each other, creating a mesh.
  2.  **Aggressive Order**: The transition from chaos to order is forceful. The "Others" demand structure.
  3.  **Scale Contrast**: Tiny individual agents vs. massive, imposing typography.
  4.  **Industrial Sound/Visuals**: Visuals imply heavy machinery or massive computation.

  **Color Philosophy**: Black background. White agents. When agents connect, the lines are a stark, bright grey. The "P" pulse might briefly flash a warning red (#FF3333) before turning white, hinting at the danger.

  **Layout Paradigm**: Architectural. The text doesn't just float; it feels anchored. The layout might imply a massive screen or a projection on a monolith.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Proximity Lines**: Dynamic triangulation between agents.
  2.  **Grid Overlay**: A faint background grid that distorts as the swarm moves over it.
  3.  **Impact Ripples**: When the text forms, a visual "shockwave" distorts the background.

  **Interaction Philosophy**: "Magnetic Influence". The mouse acts as a gravity well, attracting agents aggressively, forcing them to orbit the cursor before releasing them back to the hive.

  **Animation**: Physics-heavy. Elastic collisions. The agents slam into their positions to form the text.

  **Typography System**: `Oswald` or `Anton` (Heavy, sans-serif). Imposing and blocky.
